# Todo steps for Telegram Bot Management Panel with Database

## Backend Setup
- [ ] Choose and configure database (e.g., SQLite for simplicity or MongoDB/PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Create data models for users, messages, promotions, prices, scheduling, and analytics
- [ ] Develop API server with Node.js/Express to handle data CRUD and bot management operations
- [ ] Implement endpoints for:
  - Bot status and statistics fetching
  - Managing personalized messages (create, read, update, delete)
  - Scheduling messages with time control
  - Upload and management of images/media for messages
  - Promotions and price adjustments management
  - Fetching user interaction metrics and reports
- [ ] Integrate API with bot code to sync data and trigger actions (e.g., message sending, status updates)

## Frontend Setup
- [ ] Bootstrap React app with black/dark mode theme
- [ ] Implement dashboard home page showing bot status and usage statistics
- [ ] Build message management UI (list, create/edit personalized and scheduled messages with images)
- [ ] Build promotions and pricing adjustment UI
- [ ] Implement user interaction and analytics reports UI
- [ ] Connect frontend with backend API for full functionality

## Bot Integration
- [ ] Modify bot code to read/write data in the database via API or direct DB connection

- [ ] Track user interactions and save stats for dashboard display

## Miscellaneous

- [ ] Testing all components and integrations

This completes the plan for building a comprehensive Telegram bot management panel with database support.
